I definitely need to add comments into every post, so that maybe people can point things out since I definitely tend to say or write stupid things.

Another feature I have planned, or rather than planned, its kind of important and should've been part of the initial design, but instead am too lazy to implement right now, is for the blog posts navigation page to be split into multiple, separated, dynamically generated pages.
For now since there's just going to be a few posts it shouldn't be that big of an issue, but as time goes on, there's gonna be more posts, or at least I hope there will be, and it'll get to a point where the single blog posts page holds all the posts in one massive list, and I don't think that's going to be very good.
