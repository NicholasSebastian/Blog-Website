This is the latest and greatest version of my personal website, made with Next.js for static site generation.  
I use this site for whatever really, like posting blogs and showcasing my projects maybe.

## Sitemap

    └── 404

1.  **`/Home`**: Mix of Static and Dynamic content. Dynamic content includes the latest blogs and projects.

2.  **`/About`**: Purely Static content displaying information about me.

3.  **`/Blogs`**: Mostly Dynamic content displaying a list of blog posts, in which each post will have a dynamically generated page of its own.

4.  **`/Projects`**: Mostly Dynamic content displaying a grid of my personal projects.

5.  **`/404`**: Purely Static page displaying 404 page not found.

## Technologies Used

1.  **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Obviously.

2.  **React.js**: Best Front End JavaScript framework, makes my life easier.

3.  **Next.js**: Framework built on top of React. Lets me serve dynamically generated static sites from a CDN without needing of a server.
